# poland-yard
Simple game based on famous boardgame called Scotland Yard

## Install 

I hope you have docker and docker-compose. If not, ups, you need to install it :)
But if blue whale is already on your computer you just need to type
```docker-compose up```
then 
``` 
npm install
cd app
npm install (again, because there are Vue.js deps)
npm run build
cd ../
npm run dev-back
```
Tadam - oh, wait
you need to check URLs in code, because sometimes this repo is deployed to HEROKu and I don't have enough time to implement auto
replace urls depends on build type

If you want to play, go to[https://poland-yard.herokuapp.com](Poland-Yard) 

It way in progress so you know ;)
